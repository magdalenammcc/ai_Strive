SCENE I. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.

    Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA, and LAFEU, all in black 

COUNTESS

    In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.

BERTRAM

    And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death
    anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to
    whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.

LAFEU

    You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you,
    sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times
    good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose
    worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather
    than lack it where there is such abundance.

COUNTESS

    What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?

LAFEU
